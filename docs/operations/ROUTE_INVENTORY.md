# Route Inventory

**Audit date:** 2026-05-23  
**Router:** `src/router.tsx`  
**Route constants:** `src/constants/routes.ts`  
**Navigation data:** `src/data/navigation.json`

## Summary

| Category | Count | Launch status |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Marketing pages | 5 | Live |
| Service detail (dynamic) | 8 slugs | Live |
| Legacy redirects | 8 | Live (SPA redirect) |
| Contact | 1 | Live (real page) |

**Launch rule:** Every link in navbar, footer, mobile menu, and in-page CTAs resolves to a real page, a legacy redirect, an external booking/contact URL, or a home hash anchor.

## Static marketing routes

| Route | Component | Purpose | Accessible | Nav | Footer | Buttons / CTAs |

## Dynamic service routes

**Pattern:** `/services/:slug` → `ServiceDetailPage`  
**Invalid slug:** Redirects to `/services`

| Route | Slug | Purpose | Nav | Footer | Linked from |
|-------|------|---------|-----|--------|-------------|
| `/services/birthday-games` | `birthday-games` | Birthday service detail | Services dropdown | Birthday Games | Home categories, Services page, footer, gallery stories |
| `/services/corporate-games` | `corporate-games` | Corporate service detail | Services dropdown | Corporate Games | Same pattern |
| `/services/social-gathering-games` | `social-gathering-games` | Social gatherings detail | Services dropdown | Social Gatherings | Same |
| `/services/game-festival` | `game-festival` | Community festival detail | Services dropdown | Game Festivals | Same |
| `/services/school-and-collage-event` | `school-and-collage-event` | School/college detail | Services dropdown | School & College | Same |
| `/services/wedding-or-haldi-games` | `wedding-or-haldi-games` | Wedding/haldi detail | Services dropdown | Wedding & Haldi | Same |
| `/services/traditional-games` | `traditional-games` | Traditional games detail | Services dropdown | Traditional Games | Same |
| `/services/bollywood-games` | `bollywood-games` | Bollywood games detail | Services dropdown | Bollywood Games | Same |

All service CTAs use external Bubble booking URLs via `resolveServiceCtaHref()` — not internal routes.

---

## Legacy service redirects

**Component:** `LegacyServiceRedirect` — instant SPA redirect, no content flash.

| Legacy route | Redirects to | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|---------|
| `/corporate-events` | `/services/corporate-games` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/birthday-events` | `/services/birthday-games` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/school-events` | `/services/school-and-collage-event` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/traditional-games` | `/services/traditional-games` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/wedding-events` | `/services/wedding-or-haldi-games` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/social-gathering` | `/services/social-gathering-games` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/game-festival` | `/services/game-festival` | Old site URL compatibility |
| `/bollywood` | `/services/bollywood-games` | Old site URL compatibility |

Not linked from navigation — bookmark and external link preservation only.
